In order for cl-fpgasm-xdlrc to process xdlrc files as s-exps, the following tweaks need to be performed with sed:

1) #<space> comments are eliminated (# is tricky in Lisp)

2) #FF, #LATCH, #RAM, #ROM and #LUT have the # replaced with _, same reason

3) foo:<eqn> forms are replaced with (foo eqn), as : leads to reader problems.

run the shell script tweak:

sh tweak.sh filename    no .xdlrc suffix!
